2. To make the brine, mix together 1 tablespoon of salt, 1/2 tablespoon of Yum Yum, 1 teaspoon of five-spice powder, 1 teaspoon of sugar, the Shaoxing wine, and rice wine vinegar. Mix well and spread evenly over the butterflied chicken. Refrigerate for 1-3 hours.
3. Combine the chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, 1/4 tablespoon of Yum Yum, and the remaining 1 tablespoon of salt. Set aside.
